## Random Tease Generator

---

## ðŸ“‹ Task Description

We have **three arrays** with words, and in rows:

```javascript
let randomBodyParts = [random body parts];
var randomAdjectives = [random adjectives];
var randomWords = [randomwords];
```

And we use **three indices** to take a random word from each array. 

Then we glue them together, placing the result in the `randomInsult` variable, and that's the finished tease:

```javascript
let randomInsult = "You have" + randomBodyPart + " as " + randomAdjective + " " + randomWord + "!!!";
```

```javascript

var adjectives = [some adjectives]; // ask ChatGPT: generate me a list of adjectives words to use for teasing someone
var nouns = [some nouns];           // ask ChatGPT: generate me a list of random nouns
```

Declare and assign a random word from each array:

```javascript
let randomBodyPart = ...;

```javascript
let randomTease = `You have ${randomBodyPart} as ${randomAdjective} ${randomNoun}!!!`;
```

__Note__: your function generateRandomTaunt() should return `randomTease` when it's called.
